## 1. Title & Overview

* **Project Title:** Measuring Behavioral Fingerprints of Users in Mouse Trajectories for Continuous Authentication
* **Research Domain:** Continuous Behavioral Biometrics, Post-Login Workstation Security, and Neuromuscular Mannerism Capture.

### Summary
Traditional perimeter security mechanisms (passwords, PINs, static biometrics) verify user identity solely at initial session login. Once an operator is authenticated, host operating systems remain blind to unauthorized console takeovers, session hijacking, or automated peripheral injection. 

This research investigates an **explainable, continuous authentication model** that passively monitors user identity throughout an active session. Instead of relying on multi-minute statistical aggregations or opaque deep learning black boxes, this study captures individual **behavioral fingerprints directly from short, sub-second mouse trajectory strokes** using closed-form differential geometry, convex hull spatial bounding, Discrete Fréchet curve morphometry, and dynamic thresholding.

## 2. Core Methodology & Architecture Pipeline

The proposed experimental model processes cursor movements through an end-to-end 5-stage pipeline:

$$\text{Short-Signal Capture} \longrightarrow \text{Closed-Form Geometry} \longrightarrow \text{Convex Hull Bounding} \longrightarrow \text{Fréchet Morphometry} \longrightarrow \text{Dynamic Thresholding}$$

```

1. **Short-Signal Capture:** Segments continuous desktop mouse movement into atomic, point-to-point trajectory strokes (sub-second duration) between clicks, pauses, or sharp direction reversals.
2. **Closed-Form Geometry Extraction:** Computes localized, closed-form differential-geometric mannerisms on each stroke with explicit safeguards against division-by-zero and collinearity:
   - **Orthogonal Chord Deviation ($d_\perp$):** Perpendicular displacement from the baseline chord connecting the stroke's initial and final coordinates.
   - **Discrete Menger Curvature ($\kappa$):** Triplet circumcircle curvature capturing fine motor tremor and localized inflection points.
   - **Straightness Ratio ($S$):** Ratio of net Euclidean displacement to total cumulative path length.
3. **Convex Hull Bounding:** Wraps a minimum 2D convex polygon around the trajectory coordinates to encapsulate gross spatial dispersion, path variance, and motor overshoot.
4. **Fréchet Morphometry:** Evaluates candidate bounded trajectory curves against the user's enrolled profile using **Discrete Fréchet Distance ($\delta_F$)**, strictly preserving monotonic temporal point progression without the artificial velocity distortions common to elastic time warping.
5. **Dynamic Thresholding:** Compares curve dissimilarity scores against a calibrated decision threshold feeding a per-action dynamic trust accumulator, allowing gradual behavioral drift (such as motor fatigue) while immediately flagging anomalous stroke sequences.

## 4. Tooling & Usage Guide

### 4.1 Running the Local AI Writing Cadence Auditor
An offline Python utility is provided to audit thesis chapter drafts against Turnitin sensitivity, uniform sentence lengths (low burstiness), and banned LLM cliché n-grams:

```powershell
# Run basic audit on a chapter draft
python scripts/audit_writing.py references/background_pure_paragraphs.md

# Run with detailed paragraph-by-paragraph breakdown
python scripts/audit_writing.py references/background_pure_paragraphs.md -v

# Output results in machine-readable JSON
python scripts/audit_writing.py references/background_pure_paragraphs.md --json
```

### 4.2 Fetching New Literature Candidates
To query academic APIs (arXiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar) and cross-check new candidate papers against the compiled bibliography:

```powershell
# Run literature checker with default queries
python references/example-rrl-fetch.py

# Query a specific topic
python references/example-rrl-fetch.py --query "mouse dynamics continuous authentication"
```
